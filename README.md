# superbkk
A lightweight iOS app in MVVM architecture pattern which lists the public traffic destinations and stops within 1km from the Deak Ferenc square.

## TODO
1. When the user tap on a cell send a request with the viewModel's stopID to the BKK API and get the routes
2. Parse the received data
3. Display the data in a table on StopDetailsViewController
4. UI improvements
